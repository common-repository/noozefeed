2. Customise your display, choose the order of feeds to be displayed, change display type (list or grid) and also limit the number of feeds displayed at a time.
3. See your feed results based on your requested search. Choose to search for more feeds based on the selected feed (click 'More Like This').
4. Display your results on your Wordpress Site using a shortcode. Add a new page or update an existing page to insert the feed results.
